# Image Processing System in Verilog

This project implements a basic image processing pipeline using Verilog HDL, designed for simulation purposes. The system reads 24-bit RGB image data from a hex file, converts it to grayscale, inverts the grayscale image, and saves the processed data to text files. It consists of two main modules: a memory reader to display sample memory contents and an image processor to perform the core image transformations.

## üîß Features

- **Memory Reading**: Reads and displays contents of a sample 16-bit memory array from a hex file (`memory.hex`).
- **Image Processing**:
  - Converts 24-bit RGB image data to 8-bit grayscale using a simplified averaging formula.
  - Inverts the grayscale image by subtracting each pixel value from 255.
- **File Output**: Saves processed grayscale and inverted image data to text files (`grayscale_image.txt`, `inverted_image.txt`).
- **Simulation Focused**: Designed for simulation in Verilog environments like Vivado or ModelSim.
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for memory reading and image processing, making it easy to extend or modify.

## üß† How It Works

1. **main.v**:
   - Defines a 16-bit memory array with 5 locations (`mem[0:4]`).
   - Reads memory contents from `memory.hex` using `$readmemh`.
   - Displays the memory contents using `$display` for verification.

2. **image_processor.v**:
   - Processes a 256x256 image (configurable via parameters `ROWS` and `COLS`).
   - Reads 24-bit RGB pixel data from `image_data.hex` into a 2D array (`image_data`).
   - Converts each pixel to grayscale using the formula: `gray = (r >> 2) + (r >> 4) + (g >> 1) + (g >> 4) + (b >> 3)`.
   - Inverts the grayscale image: `inverted = 255 - gray`.
   - Stores processed data in `grayscale_data` and `inverted_data` arrays.
   - Writes the grayscale and inverted pixel values to `grayscale_image.txt` and `inverted_image.txt` using `$fwrite`.

## üì• Inputs

- **memory.hex**: Hex file containing sample memory data for `main.v` (path: `C:/Users/itzka/OneDrive/Documents/Vivado/file image processing/memory.hex`).
- **image_data.hex**: Hex file containing 24-bit RGB image data for `image_processor.v` (path: `C:/Users/itzka/OneDrive/Documents/Vivado/file image processing/image_data.hex`).

## üì§ Outputs

- **Console Output**: Displays the contents of the memory array from `main.v`.
- **grayscale_image.txt**: Contains the grayscale pixel values (8-bit) in hex format.
- **inverted_image.txt**: Contains the inverted grayscale pixel values (8-bit) in hex format.

## üöÄ Simulation and Testing

You can simulate the project using tools like Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim, or Icarus Verilog.

### Steps to Simulate

1. **Prepare Input Files**:
   - Create `memory.hex` with 5 lines of 16-bit hex values (e.g., `1A2B`, `3C4D`, etc.).
   - Create `image_data.hex` with 256x256 lines of 24-bit RGB hex values (e.g., `FF0000` for red).
   - Place both files in the directory: `C:/Users/itzka/OneDrive/Documents/Vivado/file image processing/`.

2. **Set Up the Simulation**:
   - Open your Verilog simulator (e.g., Vivado or ModelSim).
   - Create a new project and add `main.v` and `image_processor.v` as source files.
   - Compile the modules.

3. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Simulate the design. The `main.v` module will display the memory contents, and `image_processor.v` will generate the output files.
   - Check the console for memory contents and verify that `grayscale_image.txt` and `inverted_image.txt` are created with the processed data.

### Example Testbench

Since the modules use `initial` blocks, you can directly simulate them without a separate testbench. However, for more control, you can create a simple testbench to instantiate both modules:

```verilog
module tb_image_processor;
    initial begin
        #100; // Wait for the initial blocks to complete
        $finish; // End the simulation
    end

    // Instantiate the modules
    memory_reader mem_reader();
    image_processor img_proc();
endmodule
```

## üîç Applications

- **Educational Demo**: Ideal for learning Verilog, digital design, and basic image processing concepts.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Can be used as a starting point for grayscale conversion and inversion in larger image processing pipelines.
- **Simulation Testing**: Useful for testing Verilog file I/O operations and array manipulations.

## üìå Future Enhancements

- **Support for Color Image Processing**: Extend the processor to handle RGB outputs or additional color spaces (e.g., HSV).
- **Implement Additional Filters**: Add modules for blur, edge detection, or sharpening.
- **FPGA Implementation**: Adapt the design for FPGA deployment with AXI interface for SoC integration.
- **Dynamic Input Handling**: Add support for reading image data in real-time (e.g., via a UART interface).
- **Enhanced Grayscale Formula**: Use a more accurate grayscale conversion (e.g., weighted formula: `0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B`).

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Found Errors**: Ensure `memory.hex` and `image_data.hex` are in the correct directory (`C:/Users/itzka/OneDrive/Documents/Vivado/file image processing/`). Update the file paths in the Verilog code if your directory differs.
- **Empty Output Files**: Verify that the simulation runs long enough for the `initial` block in `image_processor.v` to complete. Check for file write permissions in the output directory.
- **Simulation Issues**: Ensure your simulator supports Verilog file I/O operations (`$readmemh`, `$fwrite`). Check for syntax errors in the Verilog code.
